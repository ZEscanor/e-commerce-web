        We are looking for a web developer who can walk on water, turn water into code (and preferably Wine too), and create websites that will make users weep with joy. <br/> <br/>You should have 10 years of experience with React (preferably someone who created react), be able to write a complete CMS in a weekend, and have an uncanny ability to read clients' minds.<br/>

We want someone who can work 24/7, who never gets tired, and who can juggle 20 projects at once while solving complex algorithms in their sleep. <br/> <br/>You should be a master of SEO, PPC, SMM, CMS, CRM, and OMG. If you don't know what OMG stands for, don't even bother applying because OMG we wont hire you.<br/><br/>

You should be able to write clean, efficient code while blindfolded and with one hand tied behind your back (preferably both hands). <br/> <br/> You should be familiar with every programming language ever invented, even the ones that haven't been invented yet. We prefer candidates who have built a website that has amassed a total gross income of at least a million dollars. <br/>
If you meet these qualifications, we'd love to hear from you. We offer unlimited vacation time (because you won't have time to take any), a fully stocked kitchen (because you'll never leave the office), and a salary that reflects your exceptional skills (but is still probably not enough).<br/><br/>

So what are you waiting for? Apply now and join us in our mission to change the world one website at a time! <br/><br/>

Afraid of applying? Don't worry we'll give you a guaranteed position starting at -50,000$ a year.(You pay us to keep you on the team and by team i mean you and me and by me i mean you)
